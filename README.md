# TriviaGame
This Drag Race Trivia Game is a 10 question timed trivia game centered around different moments in Rupaul's Drag Race herstory.

Players will click the "Gentlemen, Start Your Engines" button to start the game.

Players will have 15 seconds to answer each question. Both a correct and incorrect response will display a gif of the moment the question is about and will tell the user if they were right or wrong. A non-answer within the alotted time will do the same and simply say "Time's Up!"

After the ten questions are answered, or 15 seconds are up on the final question, the game will display the number of questions that the player answered correctly, incorrectly, or left unanswered, as well as a button asking if the player would like to play again, which resets the game.
